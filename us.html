The mission of MMMUT Gorakhpur Robotics Club is to unite students in an educational environment and provide students a place to pursue their interest in mechanical , electronic and software design by working on large and small scale robotics projects . Having said that we take pride in talking about our projects , be it autonomous bots, humanoids , swarm of tiny robots, robotic arms or aerial vehicles , we have'nt left any stone unturned . However, the club provides much more than just technical growth to its members , from team-building to cooperation, from perseverance to sincerity, the club teaches you a myriad f interpersonal skills essential in daily life. 
 The club is open to students with or without experience because , believe it or not , none of us had any idea of robotics when we first stepped into the clube room ,neither do we expect anything from you .
 You just need to show up and the club and its people will take care of the rest . The club's environment preputates the sharing of wisdom and experience amongst our members . All we need from you is enthusiasm!
